### Changelog from 1.2.4.0 to 1.2.5.0:


#### New Stuff:
* Button to enable/disable the ReturningPlayerBonus on dr490n emu (thanks to Hoxi and Special For for implementing)
* Setting to launch downgraded GTA as Admin if wanted (fixes some issues with SCL for some people)
* New UI/UX for initiating the important settings on first startup or settings reset. This also fixes the crash if RGL / Steam were never installed.
