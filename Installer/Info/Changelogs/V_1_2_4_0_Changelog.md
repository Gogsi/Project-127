* MTL Auth no longer opens empty explorer in rare cases.
* MTL Auth throws suggestion to Re-Install Rockstar Games Launcher if it cant find the Registry Keys to MTL Auth.
* Basic DebloatV Implementation (Shoutout to @cuzbabytonight on community.pcgamingwiki.com (and hoxi I think) for figuring out which DLC Folders are safe to delete when on 1.27)

* Using a different way to kill processes and child-processes. Hopefully no more "stuck" gta for some users.
