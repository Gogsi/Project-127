## Get me Started

* Get your GTA in a current Up-To-Date State by Repairing / Verifying Game Files via your choosen Retailer (Steam, Rockstar, Epic)
* Launch your GTA to make sure its working and in an Upgraded State.
* Download the [latest Installer](https://github.com/TwosHusbandS/Project-127/raw/master/Installer/Project_127_Installer_Latest.exe)
* Execute it. Windows will check it for Viruses. This will take 5-10 Seconds.
* Let Project 1.27 Install.
* Open Project 1.27
* Go through Initial Setup.
* I recommend Reading through all the Settings right now, and setting P127 up to your Liking


## Downgraded Game Launching and Authentication

* You have two Options of launching the game.
  * dr490n emu (default / standard)
    * For this you only need the "Required Files"
  * Launching through downgraded Socialclub (SCL).
    * NO CAPTCHAS.
    * Only available if you own GTA through Steam or Rockstar. Sorry Epic.
    * For this you need the Downgraded Social Club Files, and the SCL - GameFiles for the Game Version (1.24 or 1.27) and for your Retailer (Steam or Rockstar)
	* They will be downloaded automatically when changing Settings, so you dont need to manually Download them.

When you are launching through the dr490n Emu, P127 needs to verify that you own GTA through Rockstars Server (for legal Reasons).

It can do this in two ways:
* MTL Auth. This opens Rockstar Laucher, you sign in in the Rockstar Launcher, P127 gets your Ownership Information via that.
  * NO CAPTCHAS THIS WAY.
* Legacy Auth. (Can be enabled in P127 Settings). You log into your social Club account inside P127.
  * YOU WILL GET CAPTCHAS, AND YOU WILL HAVE TO LOG IN EVERY TIME YOU OPEN P127

## Help / Common Issues

* When Project 1.27 crashes when Downloading or Importing Files, try to download the ZIP manually from the Help Section of P127 then go to Settings -> Import ZIP Manually and select the file you just downloaded. If that doesnt work, rightclick the ZIP Extraction Path in Settings, copy your downloaded zip file there, right click -> extract here.

* When Launching GTA V does not launch the Version it says it is (Text in Top Left Corner), make sure the Path to GTA V is set correctly in the settings of Project 1.27.

* When Upgrading / Downgrading does not work as expected in general, verify Game Files via Steam / Rockstar / Epic (Or re-download GTAV), clicking \"Repair GTA\" inside P127 Generel Settings and re-download the components.

* Game Updates from Rockstar might break things. This usually shows itself as P127 saying: "Downgraded (1.53)", which of course makes no sense. Re-Installing the Components inside the ComponentManager you are using for Downgrading and Re-Applying a Downgrade should fix this. Steam / Epic is not affected by this

* If the current Authentication Method is not working, you can always go back to the Legacy-Auth inside Settings.

* If the normal P127 Downgrade with Custom Auth does not work for you, feel free to try out "Launching Through SocialClub"

* On Legacy Auth: When the Auth / Login appears to load infinitely, please try to re-start Project 1.27, and wait a few  minutes. If its still not working, Rockstar just might not like your IP. In this case try using a Hotspot from your phone or a VPN or any other internet connection.

* On Legacy Auth: When P127 crashes just when you are expected to login (on click of Auth Button, or on Game Launch when not logged in already), you might fail to connect to Rockstar Server. Make sure you are connected to the internet.

* If something isnt right, Verifying (Rightclick on Install Button), Re-Installing or manually deleting and Installing a Component is always worth a try

* If you cant see the MultiMonitor Overlay, RIGHT-click the \"Enable Multi Monitor Mode\" Checkbox to Reset its Position
			
* If something is still not working, you can always try verifying Files via Steam / Rockstar / Epic and hitting the "RESET ALL" Button inside P127 Settings.This might take a few minutes, and Project 1.27 will quit automatically when its done. Re - Open it and everything should work again.
