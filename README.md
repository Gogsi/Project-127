# Project-127
Custom Client to achieve a working 1.27 GTA V for everyone on PC

TempReadMe:

Instructions:
- Read Everything on here, and every message or popup the software gives you.
- Download this installer: 
	INSTALL THE PROGRAM ON THE SAME DRIVE WHERE GTA V IS INSTALLED. If you want to know why, PM me (@thS#0305)
	Probably best to install this program inside of the GTAV Installation, but just make sure its on the save drive
	
	INSTALL THIS WITH A FULLY UPDATED AND UP TO DATE GTA V.
	ALSO LAUNCHING THE UPGRADED GAME FOR NOW, ONLY WORKS WITH STEAM. YOU CAN MANUALLY START IT VIA ROCKSTAR THO.
- Windows 10 Checks all Files for Virus if they are run for the first time. 
	If you open a file (Installer or Program) and the file doesnt appear to be running, just wait 20 seconds.
	Should open within that timeframe. 
	In general. If you click and it looks like nothing is happening. Wait 30 seconds before clicking again.
- Clicking the button in the top left corner. Opens a Menu.
- Buttons should be self explainatory.
- GTA Button tells you the state of GTA V (Upgraded, Downgraded, Running, Not Running)
- Game automatically detects if the installation is upgraded or downgraded 
- If upgrading / downgrading doesnt yield good results...validate files via Steam, then click "Repair". Should fix most issues.
- You probably should click "Upgrade" before uninstalling this program
- If something is still not working, please uninstall the program via control panel, run this file (https://github.com/TwosHusbandS/Project-127/raw/master/Installer/Cleanup.exe) and then install again.
- If something is still not working, please include the file "AAA - Logfile.log" when reporting the bug

Beta Test Instructions:
- Download a ZIP File, linked in the beta channel of the discord. 
- Click "Import ZIP" and select the File that you downloaded.
- Upgrade / Downgrade Game via Buttons on the Left.
- Start Game (doesnt matter which State) via the Button on the Bottom Left Corner.
- This is where you guys come into Play. We have not found a consistent way of Launching the Crack for everyone.
- We have: "PlayGTAV.exe", "Test3Fixed.bat", "Test9.bat", "Test15.bat", "Test17.bat" as way of launching.
	They can all be launched with and without Admin Rights. Just try around and report back.

	Hope much of this works, Hope you can use this, Hope we can have some good Data and Findings, and I hope everyone has a good day.
